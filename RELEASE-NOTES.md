## Version 3.0.1

* Tranquility Reader 3.0.1 has been rewritten using WebExtensions APIs

* Ability to export/import offline content (please be sure to export 
  offline content from version 2.0 and manually import into version 3.0.1)

* Reduced set of customization options; Display font name will have 
  to be typed in manually (limitation of WebExtensions APIs)

* Removed support for background image and wikipedia/wiktionary 
  search facility

* No keyboard shortcut (very limited options available through 
  WebExtensions APIs - waiting for more customization capabilities)

* Several minor bug fixes that were put off until this version

Please note that due to the extensive changes that were made, there 
may be regression in the code and past bugs that were fixed may reappear. 
Please leave your comments or send feedback to the support email 
address so that these bugs can be addressed.
